### The GDShader Language Server
---
This extension is a language server for the Godot shading language that runs independently of the Godot engine. It's a fully-featured language server (with some excpetions) and should offer a nice alternative to Godot's editor if you prefer VSCode, as I do.
### Features
---
GDShader-lsp currently has support for:
* Syntax highlighting
* Smart code completion
* Type checking & hover support
* Helpful error messages
* Include preprocessor macros
### Missing Features
---
GDShader-lsp does not have (but will soon have)
* Preprocessor support (other than include statements)
* Jump-to-definition
